# üöÄ SpaceX Launch Success Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of SpaceX launch records to uncover patterns, trends, and key factors influencing mission success.

By exploring historical launch data, we identify how factors such as **launch site**, **orbit type**, **payload mass**, and **time (year)** affect the likelihood of a successful launch.

## üìä Key Visualizations and Insights

### 1. **Flight Number vs Launch Site by Outcome**
- Shows how SpaceX launches became more successful over time.
- CCAFS SLC 40 and KSC LC 39A were the most frequently used and improved steadily.
- Earlier missions had higher failure rates, while later missions show near-perfect success.

### 2. **Payload Mass vs Launch Site by Outcome**
- Heavier payloads are generally more successful in recent years.
- Launches from KSC LC 39A handled high-mass missions with high success rates.
- VAFB SLC 4E had fewer launches, but most were successful.

### 3. **Success Rate by Orbit Type**
- Orbits like **GEO, HEO, ES-L1, and SSO** had **100% success rates**.
- Orbits like **GTO, SO, and ISS** showed **lower success**, indicating more complexity or risk.
  
### 4. **Flight Number vs Orbit by Success**
- Shows that as the number of flights increased, success across all orbits improved.
- GTO remains challenging despite improvements, while SSO and HEO consistently succeed.

### 5. **Payload Mass vs Orbit by Success**
- Payload mass alone doesn‚Äôt dictate success‚Äî**orbit type** plays a bigger role.
- Missions to **SO and GTO** with high payloads had more failures.

### 6. **Launch Success Rate by Year**
- SpaceX's success rate climbed from **0% in 2010‚Äì2013** to **over 90% by 2019**.
- Demonstrates a steep learning curve and technological maturity.
